Key Findings from the Analysis

1️⃣ Day vs. Night Accidents

Our analysis revealed whether accidents are more frequent during the day or at night.

The pie chart clearly showed the distribution, helping identify riskier driving hours.

2️⃣ States with Highest Night Accident Percentage

We identified the top 10 states where night-time driving is more dangerous.

This can help in improving road safety measures (better street lighting, stricter night patrols).
